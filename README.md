# JBE
Engine project to wrap SDL

The goal of this project is to have some of the functionality provided by SDL
conveniently abstracted and made easier to use.

I intend to be using SDL in the future for personal projects that need 
windowing and graphics, as well as support for gamepads, so that is the 
stuff that I will be focusing on mainly.
